The document states the fund 'invests systematically in a dynamic universe of US companies from the S&P 500' but does not provide a specific minimum percentage threshold like 70%.\nAsset allocation ranges: The prospectus mentions an allocation range of 'up to 30% of its net assets in the equities of issuers whose registered office is not located in the US'. The document does not mention any allowance for non-US equities; it consistently emphasizes a 'Focus on US equities' ('Focus sur les actions américaines') and investment in 'US companies from the S&P 500'. This implies a purely US-centric allocation, contradicting the prospectus's allowance for non-US exposure.\nGeographic allocation: The prospectus allows 'up to 30% of its net assets in the equities of issuers whose registered office is not located in the US'. The document repeatedly states a 'Focus on US equities' and 'US companies from the S&P 500', and its Morningstar category is 'US Large Cap Blend Equities', suggesting an exclusively US focus without mentioning any non-US allowance.

The document states the fund 'invests systematically in a dynamic universe of US companies from the S&P 500' but does not provide a specific minimum percentage threshold like 70%.\nAsset allocation ranges: The prospectus mentions an allocation range of 'up to 30% of its net assets in the equities of issuers whose registered office is not located in the US'. The document does not mention any allowance for non-US equities; it consistently emphasizes a 'Focus on US equities' ('Focus sur les actions américaines') and investment in 'US companies from the S&P 500'. This implies a purely US-centric allocation, contradicting the prospectus's allowance for non-US exposure.\nGeographic allocation: The prospectus allows 'up to 30% of its net assets in the equities of issuers whose registered office is not located in the US'.
